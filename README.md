üîê Password Generator & Strength Checker

A simple yet powerful Java console-based tool designed to create secure, randomized passwords and evaluate their strength with intelligent criteria.

üí° Project Overview

This project was born out of a spark during my winter break in the second year of university, shortly after completing a course on Object-Oriented Programming with Java. Eager to apply what I‚Äôd learned, I was on the hunt for a fun and practical idea. One evening, while chatting with my dad about the importance of strong passwords for his social accounts, the concept hit me‚Äîwhy not build a random password generator?

Within a week, the initial version was functional. As development progressed, I added a password strength evaluation system to help users understand how secure their passwords really are. Though it worked well, I realized that the console interface might be intimidating for non-technical users. That led me to the next phase: creating a GUI version, which you can find in my Password-Services repository.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

1. Password Generation
	‚Ä¢	Users are prompted with yes/no questions to include:
	‚Ä¢	Uppercase letters
	‚Ä¢	Lowercase letters
	‚Ä¢	Numbers
	‚Ä¢	Special characters
	‚Ä¢	Users then specify the desired length of their password.
	‚Ä¢	Based on the responses, a custom character pool is generated.
	‚Ä¢	The system randomly assembles a password from the selected pool and displays it.

2. Password Strength Evaluation
	‚Ä¢	The application checks for:
	‚Ä¢	Use of uppercase letters
	‚Ä¢	Use of lowercase letters
	‚Ä¢	Presence of digits
	‚Ä¢	Inclusion of symbols
	‚Ä¢	Minimum length of 8 characters
	‚Ä¢	Extended length of 16+ characters
	‚Ä¢	Based on these criteria, the tool assigns a strength rating (Weak, Medium, Good, Great) and gives helpful feedback.

3. Security Tips & Best Practices
	‚Ä¢	The console displays practical advice on creating secure passwords, such as:
	‚Ä¢	Avoiding reused passwords
	‚Ä¢	Steering clear of repetitive characters and patterns
	‚Ä¢	Not using common words or sequences
	‚Ä¢	Tips to resist brute-force and dictionary attacks
